A dark syntax theme for atom, inspired by the bold yellow in Watchmen.
Happy to incorporate your feedback, just mark it as an issue, thanks!

![Code highlighting example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjaypojo/atom-dark-watchmen/master/watchmenesque.png)

Watchmenesque now supports syntax highlighting within markdown preview code blocks

```javascript
if (theme == "watchmenesque") {
  console.log("This block is syntax highlighted!");
}
```
